I've created a comprehensive Java program that demonstrates all the required exceptions. Let me explain the key aspects of the implementation:

Structure: The program is organized into separate methods for each exception type, making it easy to understand and test each scenario independently.
Documentation: Each method is commented to explain what type of exception it's demonstrating and how it works.
Exception Categories:

Checked Exceptions (require explicit handling):

IOException
FileNotFoundException
EOFException
SQLException
ClassNotFoundException


Unchecked Exceptions (runtime):

ArithmeticException
NullPointerException
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
ClassCastException
IllegalArgumentException
NumberFormatException




Best Practices Demonstrated:

Proper use of try-catch blocks
Use of finally blocks where appropriate
Specific exception handling before more general exceptions
Meaningful error messages
Resource cleanup in IO operations



To run this program, you'll need to:

Save it as ExceptionHandlingDemo.java
Compile it using javac ExceptionHandlingDemo.java
Run it using java ExceptionHandlingDemo

Some exceptions (like SQLException) might require additional setup or libraries. The code is designed to fail gracefully and demonstrate the exception handling mechanism.
Would you like me to explain any specific part of the implementation in more detail?
